# Understanding what HTML Is
**HTML(*HyperText Markup Language*)** is used to structure content on the web. It consists of: 
* Elements: The building blocks of HTML (e.g., `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<div>`).
* Tags: Start and end markers that define elements.s

Example can be found [**`index.html`**](#document_structure/index.html).


# Tag
An opening tag indicates the starting point in the document where the tag takes effect.
```cmd
    <>
```
A closing tag indicates the ending point in the document where the tag stops having an effect.
```cmd
    </>
```

A void element is an element that only needs an opening tag
Examples include :
- ```cmd <img>```
- ```cmd <br>```
- ```cmd <input>```
- ```cmd <meta>```
- ```cmd <link>```
- ```cmd <hr>```
